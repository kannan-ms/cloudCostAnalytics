import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';
import { useOutletContext } from 'react-router-dom';

// We need to modify App.jsx significantly to pass state down, 
// OR we can just handle the state in a wrapper.
// Actually, since MainLayout is in the Route, we can render Dashboard as a child.
// Let's create a DashboardWrapper component in the same file as App.jsx or separate.

// Better approach: Modify App.jsx to hold the state? No, that's messy.
// Let's make a DashboardPage component that includes the Layout and Dashboard.
